# Containerization
This is the place for my containerization learning


# Docker Technology

1. Runtime - Containerd & runc
   - runc:
      - Low-level runtime
      - Interface with the underlying OS
      - Start & stop container
   - Containerd:
      - Manages container lifecycle
      
3. Daemon - dockerd
   - exposing API
   - managing images, volumes, networks
   - provide easy-to-use interface
4. Orchestrator - swarm/kubernetes
